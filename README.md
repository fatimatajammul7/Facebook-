# Facebook Simulation Project
Let's understand how this facebook code works!
## Overview
This project simulates a basic version of a social network platform (Facebook) in C++. It incorporates users, pages, posts, likes, comments, and interactions among users and pages.

## Features
- **Users and Pages**
  - Add and manage users.
  - Add and manage pages.
  - Associate users with friends and liked pages.
  
- **Posts and Comments**
  - Users and pages can create posts.
  - Posts can receive likes and comments.
  - View posts with details about likes and comments.

- **Search Functionality**
  - Search for keywords across users, pages, and posts.

- **Timeline and Home View**
  - View timeline and home feed for users.

- **System Date**
  - Set and use a system-wide date for timestamping activities.

## File Structure
- `SocialNetworkUsers.txt`: Contains user data.
- `SocialNetworkPages.txt`: Contains page data.
- `SocialNetworkPosts.txt`: Contains post data.
- `SocialNetworkComments.txt`: Contains comment data.

## Example Usage
### Command Simulation
1. Set the current user.
2. View the friend list and liked pages of the current user.
3. Like a post and view the updated like list.
4. Add comments to posts and view the updated post details.
5. View a specific page's details.
6. Search for keywords across the network.

### System Output
The output of commands is printed to the console, showing the results of actions such as viewing posts, liking posts, adding comments, and searching data.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using any C++ compiler.
2. Ensure all the required data files (`SocialNetworkUsers.txt`, `SocialNetworkPages.txt`, `SocialNetworkPosts.txt`, `SocialNetworkComments.txt`) are in the same directory as the executable.
3. Run the program to see the command simulation in action.
